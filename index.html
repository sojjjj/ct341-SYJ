          <h2>BharatPe founder asks for the removal of CEO from board</h2>
          <p>
            The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has assembled a review
            board that will be tasked with investigating major national
            cybersecurity incidents in an effort to “meaningfully improve” the
            nation’s cyber resilience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), whose creation was set in
            motion by a May 2020 executive order signed by President Biden in
            response to the SolarWinds attack, will be tasked with studying the
            cause and fallout from major hacks so that the government, industry
            and security agencies can better protect national networks and
            infrastructure, according to DHS. The board has been loosely modeled
            on the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which
            investigates air crashes, train derailments and other transportation
            accidents.
